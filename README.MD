##Lazy Scientist II
#Android Application

The Dundee iGEM team of 2011 created an Android application named the Lazy Scientist, and during the 2012 project, I chose to follow up the application with a suite of useful tools for biology students. The main goal was to provide some useful applications and to provide access to the source code to enable developers to add, modify and change the application to suit their needs. The app is free to download, and the full source code is provided.

* Ratio to Percentage/ Percentage to Ratio Convertor
* OD660 to Cell Count Estimator
* Simple Dilution Calculator
* Serial Dilution Checker

For full technical details, visit the original project website at

(** Note: The OD660 calculator is based on a single sample set of data that, for obvious reasons, can only provide an estimate of cell count. For more accurate OD calculations, in-situ, calibrated laboratory equipment should be used.)

As usual, I have released the source and compiled binaries under the GPL GNU version 3 license, please respect it.
